i mean that you have to really be her friend .
r u posing a <unk> question ?
i do nt intend to be mean .
because some women send subtle messages to men rather than being clear
let us bring coffee and comunicate and i'm from that point !
also i dislike it when my father is unhappy .
ask him if u should go see a doctor .
he probably has many things to worry about right now other than you .
but i do nt believe that he will be married or leave u due to lack of marrage
will i always feel that way ?
hey he may enjoy all of the waiting , dreaming and flirting
also i would like to try again .
some men shave , it depends on the woman .
well if u r really attracted to this guy , then smile and speak nicely to him .
i m not certain whether he loves u , but he definitely likes u
women are <unk>
i realize i m overly <unk> when it comes to people .. how can i stop this ?
doing that does sound rather feminine ......
sometimes , if the good <unk> the bad , then the difficulties r worth it .
that s if both of you agree to do this .
well why do you like the one boy who picks on you ?
in highschool , men sometimes think that they do nt need u that badly until u r gone .
date.com if a male mite of u , do nt nt be sry if u state alot .
do i wanna be in love ?
they will think u are <unk> if u look at them <unk>
i think that u r right , it is confusing ......
how do i get my hubby other to show me that he loves me .
that s if u truly luv them
do nt sell yourself , even if he is wealthy
u sound live a very lovely person , so do nt allow these women to make u feel bad .
i do nt know , but i have knowledge of another <unk> that i visit ..
i dnt urge u to consider how many overly confident women exist
without being in a relationship ...... that might appear to be a little asian
he asked if i would like to use his <unk> .
u should never allow a man to mistreat u
absolutely not , he is too <unk> and i m <unk> <unk> .
u can tell him if he says yes .
what was the mistake that you took part in ?
king has a song about this , it is called ' only your mother loves u
why r we in a relationship if our partner treats us badly after we fall in love ?
if u ve tryed it , what was it like ?
it is not a turn off if she drinks too much .
if that 's want you want .
it s like getting rid of a drug habit
wow i shud to do that the next time that i m dating .
what s your desire , hey ?
it sounds like you both are comfortable with how things are now .
do nt allow her to dominate your life for she will jus have to learn to deal with it
if he does nt go out with you , do nt worry as there are plenty of other options
no man gave give you everything you want .
if you want to stay married , you need to find yourself .
start with a simple common question and i'm from that point ......
b of their desire to travel to a location w/ by u
trust him , and do nt bring the matter up again .
i m still trying to work up my nerves to try that out .
find the one who loves you also .
i will be ur hubby , is u come to me town ......
stay very far away from this man .
it s your choice not to dislike one , i luv them all , to say the least .
i would kinda kno 4 3 or 4 .
he s a <unk> and has been telling that to some young woman .
i knew all my b / girlfriends were nt the one until i met my wife .
do nt try to have both of them at once , whatever you do .
gals w/ is nt the only thing important in life !
i ve a yahoo e - mail address and that s bein for me
for me , fun ...... eating meals ...... ......
hey he was a little busy afterward ......
that will just be sexual experiance ......
do nt approach her and let her know that u find her looks very hot
it sounds like you are going through plenty of things right now .
hey u shud b ask a girl @ the <unk> , since i m a boy
i had always felt the same way , but my views changed when i met my true love !
your best friend is a good choice to marry in nobody else works out .
i do nt want to approach suddenly and ask , ' will u go out with me ?
unless u know him fairly well , u r <unk> yourself out out there to get hurt .
if its your personal hubby in something its not good or bad
they annoy you all outta the day .
either go to hawaii or pay someone
i can jus stop caring about him and forget about him as though he meant nothing to me .
is it soo a clear <unk> that turns yellow when it ?
it is a turn off if she sits on your best friend 's lap when drunk .
he had a controlling personality .
<unk> is one of the gifts we can give ourselves ......
u should get married only after u have been with a man for at least 2 years .
hi and hugs to all my fellow girls at cone !
when you are <unk> her , just be yourself .
i have no idea what u are trying to say ......
a man asked if i would mind cuddling with him .
why would some men do that ?
a few good women are left , u jus have to look in the right places ......
u should either move on , or work it out with ur partner .
get a hold of yourself , how could u love a person that u do nt even speak to ?
find a talented girl who is also pretty .
that does nt mean that you are <unk> .
it 's the only time in your life , you 're able to live out true love !
u will have to find an answer yourself
give them 2 months , and they will get over you .
after some time , u will not see the color
he probably wants to know if you 're interested in him .
if she is no longer interested in u
u r definitely not a asian woman , so do nt worry .
no ur exists for forcing a person to feel romantically w/ u ......
u should break up and keep yourself open to other options
have you had a <unk> <unk> ?
i can jus say yes and mention that i an proud and have long black hair
i have a friend in a similar situation
i do nt know , its its you are young .
hi my name is going to remain anonymous , but i ve been working together with this person for years .
if you honestly love him then you will tell him .
if you 're honestly attracted to her , go with your emotions .
think about whether u can really afford it and , if u want to , then go alittle .
get your old life back so you can stay alive .
dude , what you are saying is she <unk>
do nt w/ flirtatious dialogue .. such behavior is n't appealing
its some women would say that it hurts a lot .
if i were mad , it would be easier to do .
u also should move on if they have .
u r being punished , so u do n't get to watch tv tv for a month .
tell him , and it would nt seem psychotic , because u have to know one another for awhile .
it seems very complicated .. could u please explain it again in simple terms ?
give them a chance to discover all of your talents .
unless , it is with the 2nd male
my boyfriend loves me very much and does nt desire to lose me
if they are brunette or not is what matters .
after a while it has to be played out .
everyone , even if they do nt admit it , likes to be told they are sexy .
i like to go dancing at clubs in <unk> <unk>
good luck , but remember to do your homework .
i prefer natural appearances , rather than a full face of makeup
if u r interested in the man , then damn it .
we are now only just divorced .
someone isn't women do nt have feelings ?
actions are better then words
i ' have been contemplating a mid - level pink <unk> , hey what should it be w/ ?
watch for if he <unk> , sends an <unk> mail or even cares .
be sure to never ignore her , listen to her , and do nt change the subject
he s my only source of income until i graduate from college
she will kick u if it is not wrong .
i do nt believe i mind , either way .
do nt eat in the same place you b / f .
2 2 get some blonde <unk> as well
do n't worry about him , concentrate on your classes , and you boyfriend .
i do nt think i should have done that .
foreplay is important and should last , at the bare <unk> , 5 minutes
what s a special gift i can give to my brother - in - law on his birthday ?
damn to be + and do nt act <unk>
if they do nt , then u will have to continue with your life .
your first kiss , hey , should be heavenly ......
in a family life , this is the most beautiful
most importantly , be genuine
i know 3 men i can do that with .
it s okay to jump on him if he s flirting with her .
stick with the boys who are either thirteen or 12
tell him <unk> u jus want to be friends r r disappointed by ur ur ur actions actions
that s good , it is similar to getting ur father 's blessing .
unless u r very desperate wait for him to ask you out .
if he insists then it does'nt sex is his only goal .
i would enjoy having some fun with u , that s why i answered this ridiculous question ......
do u feel in that manner ?
give ur brother some money and kick him that he shud b leave .
atleast he will call you .
something you can o is imagine your life with out him or her .
i pick the domestic <unk>
do u love her deeply ?
men get bored before women do .
u can save money with respect to flowers
if you are not happy then you need to fix it or leave .
just because he has potential to be a decent boyfriend , does nt mean that he will be .
u can luv dem a citizen 's arrest ......
having a big penis does n't mean you are good in bed .
yes it looks kinda beautiful on almost any any woman ......
men have issues with secrets ......
yes it depend ..... the man
people had questioned me , why was i rushing ?
both of them do nt respect your feelings
even though i see him each week in <unk> i can nt find the courage to talk to him .
i do nt find a man appealing who dosent that way .
i m attracted to men who shave their legs .
is gay , or is it jus curiosity ?
in my opinion ...... they do .
it s a wrong decision that can nt be undone !
i lost my virginity in a park when i was 16
they ve never met in person but she says they are in love .
ask him if he would like to dance with you .
live life to the fullest and have faith
i do nt know if you fell down , but i want to have sex .
he knows that you like him , so just ask him on a date .
<unk> your fear and kick him .
i would nt drive for 5 hours just to spend time with someone unless i really liked her a lot .
her friend to talk with her on the phone ?
u should play sports with ur male friends .
..... r romantic love , u feel <unk> , delighted , and <unk> jus <unk> on that shit
i can nt picture my life without my husband .
we seem to always push away the ones who we love .
if you both feel the same way when you are older , then go for it .
i use the term ' man ' very lightly when smartest you
personally , i prefer a and b cups .
any woman looks attractive when standing beside an unattractive man
it has happened to me , and now i m dating said person .
just be honest about your feelings towards her .
show her your nude infant photographs ......
why do homosexuals look to marriage ?
we <unk> in sex on the hood of my car in the light rain
why should men grow up if women expect men to act like that ?
u need to do this a few times to get comfortable .
while having marrage is similar to a fantasy ......
at the moment ...... i think he is angry ...... upset and tryin to be with u
if anyone knows the answer , please let me know
red stands for love , black stands for death , and so on .
i like someone with some weight because i feel cheated with a thin one .
if u so not know , ask someone who has the answer
his mum to make it up to u will be enjoyable
the one that pick on you usually likes you .
alright i ve been attracted to this girl since i since i was in the ninth grade ......
did you see her looking at you ?
i never knew that life could be so exceptional .
what s best for the both of you ?
at least she did n't give you a fake number .
omg in my opinion ...... u r not r not asian ......
hey let them get married if they can nt control themselves
she calls him often .
why bother if you are already doing it ?
many times you have loved a man , but were nt sure if he loved you back .
should i break up with him because of his mother ?
make a nice move , and if there is no responce , she is nt interested ......
i have friends that get married after six months of dating .
demonstrate ur skills to her .
u will look silly .
that s a culture that has things right .
if you do n't ask the question , you will always wonder about the answer .
i would suggest not worrying about it ...
what s the worst thing that could happend ?
i m confused and do nt know what to do because i hate for the girl to be that way .
u should find someone who does nt hate u .
do nt be rude .
certain men jus have no <unk> toward dancing
this is not an controling generation .
depends on if u were nothin able to trust him
unattractive and ugly men jus accept what they r able to get
people choose to be husbands and wives for reasons .
it s not worth it , if all you do is argue .
have a good time in jail asking your cell mate that question .
are you asking if i like you ?
what did you kiss ?
females have <unk> @ sex with other females , myself included !
1 thirty - 2 is fine and she does nt have to be younger than you
when that crap , ur decision will be easier to make ......
he cheated , hey , which i guess means i can lift or carry my husband .
try to make the best out of a bad situation
are you looking for friendship ?
i guess that he would make a great valentine
this is difficult due to the many temptations .
does it generally take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship ?
it will all depend on when u r ready
of course i would love to meet women
it s just the way things are .
it s ok to be friends with someone online , but there should be limits .
can u imagine starting a family with him ?
should he refuse ur intrests , his value is too low to b / c
to tell the truth , u will learn , but u can't experience things
hopefully , you married your husband because you love him .
i know i have someone who will be waiting when i come home
get away from it all , go enjoy a massage .
i do nt know where to start .
that depends , r u an attractive shit w/ an athletic form ?
r u referring to your avatar ?
if a man cares about you , then he will call .
in my opinion ...... there s a large difference between ' having marrage ' and ' making love .
u do n't need to stay together , even if you have a child .
r u a young woman from a <unk> environment or from an <unk> environment ?
getting married and having children can be <unk> , but ur studies can not be .
i ve never attended it .
do u want to be in a relationship with the same man ?
how often can u have sexual relations w/ pamela anderson ?
u should make sure that getting ur point across does nt nut in her hating u
this just hits too close to home for me , my mother also , has presence .
i love to run my fingers through <unk> hair .
i m referring to the two of you collectively .
the right woman will come along if u r patient ...... ......
i wanna my wife to grow as well
he is obviously shy , its you should make a move .
the doctor was surprised as well
maybe you believe it is a no , but it is a yes .
men do nt , only little boys .
maybe ask if they would like to go on a date sometime soon .
it <unk> to me , twice .
u should nt go out with a man because u feel the ' necessity ' to .
u would nt be asking , if u really wanted to be be with him .
and i just pray that it never passes !
most women are waiting for a man to tell her his true feelings
women are more passionate during sex .
totally , to impress her .
<unk> towards me and kissing me gently on only the forehead
i m not that type of person , hey i know plenty of people like that .
okay it depends on how deeply you r starting to experience emotions for this boy !
in advance , thank u for the <unk>
why do they wanna be married ?
we like to be approached softly , with some <unk> chasing
i would like a trip to an info park , or a museum ......
i ve feelings for a person and need to know if i m in love
do u enjoy fake nails or <unk> nails ?
first , plan what u desire and do nt worry about what everyone else desires ......
i do nt understand you .
i like the perfume that u wear .
i think most men do nt care , but it does depend on the shit person
it has nothing to do with being vulnerable , young or <unk> .
do nt get married so early in the relationship .
u r not a good person of u plan to be married to ur wife .
be the best version of yourself , and if he s impressed he will talk to u
u do n't want to be with anyone , but that person .
he s getting married , stop pursuing it .
did u ignor to her the annoying nature of her daily check - <unk> with u ?
when i move in i was asked out by my neighbor
most teen - aged boys prefer teen girls like enjoy <unk>
he played a good game of basketball .
do nt worry .
r u someone who enjoys arguing and fighting ?
the most important issue ...... is nt damn to retaliate at the shit that <unk> u
one man willing to move 1 - 1 hours and 12 hundred miles just to be with me .
have u seen a doctor yet ?
its not not a <unk> , but the thin woman definitely was .
u should pursue an active life and not waste my time .
it s comparable to over - <unk> in chocolate and then complaining because u ve gained weight
i traveled there and he was present .
if he is single , go for it .
if u do nt obey men like this , they typically become the sort who beat their wives
are you or are you not attracted to him ?
if u r sure , hey , then u should tell ur parents is u have nt already done so . .
many people will probably reject u
do u believe he has the same feelings towards u ?
some men only say that word , if they mean it .
it wud that he likes u , and should should show him how u feel .
i m of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name
friends are forever because guys come and go .
try to imagine that it was considered love .
i guess u should be ready even if ur relationship <unk> the 4 seasons .
all right , presently certain men like women of that type and others , not as much .
if you want children , then be a <unk> .
younger men and older women , good idea or not ?
he wants to continue .
omg there s no alternative to the proper <unk> of ' love .
also , your self - image is very important ......
i say those things and i m female .
trust me , girls can be just as perverted .
flowers are nice , even if the do nt last long .
there r films that i have yet to see .
she is a very sweet girl , just the person you are looking for !
try to use your brain and not your manhood , maybe she does nt love you .
no disrespect intended .. but , that does sound like a lady 's name .
i would nt take the trouble to call him back .
no women i ' m attracted to in my list , omg i choose my neighbors bf ......
marraige is about trust and communication .
do nt listen to anyone else 's advice .
what should i do to be successful with her ?
give them a rose and express ur love for them
it s unusual ...... i agree ...... hey it s nothing bad
u need to see noe what 's 1st for u both .
they r woman enough for a man , but they are n't as <unk> as us
exactly , especially when she became sick .
i can nt assist any further without more info
kissing is something you can nt do wrong or right .
take time to decide .
enjoying yourself with male friends is wrong .
i would say , that it is more of a trust issue ......
i need someone to assist me in figuring this out .
then move on if he still does nt like you .
he probably is n't interested either .
try to make it yourself whenever possible
can you do anything else besides work and fix things ?
i told her i sincerely loved her .
it seems that all of the male senior students think that <unk> girls are asian , which rite .
so , how do i jus kiss him ?
if u check in the deleted boobs it should be there .
i hope that u find a nice girl to date .
i do nt believe that s a good idea , u r not there for that purpose ......
it s a very long list .
i would say brokeback mountain .. you will be happy even if it is a man .
if u do nt base your relationship on marrage , then it is ok .
1st also it is a <unk> of <unk> to <unk> the 15yrs at the marriage ceremony .
hold on and stay strong and good luck !
um , <unk> get - together for relatives ......
if u r skeptical about the performance piece of it , then do nt do it
i m married now .
i guess it is totally dependent ..... age and <unk>
once you have children , u will need to decide on a last name
your child will find it difficult enough growing up without a father .
bald men look like children to me , i do n't find it attractive .
ask what the score of the last game was .
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex .
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married .
of course , let me get to know you more .
i <unk> a size c or moms <unk> bigger is a waste .
decieve and <unk> and then <unk> some more .
they have nt ve nothin and the pleasure is twice as nice !
my wife does nt like to wear those <unk> .
we are unaware of what you look like .
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life .
i think this is better than my personal life .
do n't go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex .
speak with ur best friend and determine if it s especialy
it sounds strange , but it worked for me , in about 3 to 5 days ......
i do nt like it when he teases u about the little things .
no because i m not yet married .
a large number of guyz appreciate <unk> women .. they r basicly african american
if u admire him , then u should nt care , stay with him .
do they mock you when you are with him ?
u should nt get married if u feel this strongly about it
it 's strongly dependent on whether or not a person is <unk> ......
u need to move on and enter a relationship w/ someone who does nt hate u .
u should <unk> thinkin of her and sooner or later one of u will ask the other out .
i asked him if he was blowing me off .
its some vulgar young men enjoy the younger asian ladies
make sure it is your decision ......
tell him you are looking to keep it casual .
this freindship is a soo one with lots of problems
they ve been fairly favorable years , not always the easiest
we ve seen each other , everyday , for 4 4 to 5 years .
imagine that i m the man you want , and then date me
it never <unk> anyone to flirt a little !
u should stick with what u feel inside
i wish u luck
is it bad if i have not kissed the girl i ve been with for 9 months ?
it s the woman 's decision
i guess they look better than many other <unk>
it would be ok the day after .
see if she is <unk> for dinner and a movie .
some men do n't think of their partner when they just get to it .
plz ask the question in english .. i m unable to understand u
i dunno , but i ve never felt that way .
remember , no bird has ever tried to fly with one <unk> .
i rnt think about this issue .
u will never find a hubby , if u appear to be <unk>
i met <unk> recently , and i want to know if she likes me .
do nt jus sit around and wait for the phone to ring .
be quiet and be whatever sexual experiance that u wish
if he comes to his senses , great .. if not , u should move on .
he may love u , but he also may want to disappoint his father
u should take action before it is too late
this woman does n't want a man who <unk> her .
i 'd enjoy hearing the viewpoint of an african american woman @ this subject ......
plz help me win this <unk> against her !
almost without exception ( not constantly ) those are men soo in age to yourself , more or less ......
when will <unk> b to realize this ?
i ' m glad wit what i should do .
u visit a bar and drink until u r inebriated
i r as such in the company of my present romantic partner ......
if u have to ask , then that s a negative ......
do nt sit there and wait untill he realizes that you are a good one .
even though i m getting divorced , i m still stuck with this .
your girlfriend will only think that you r being a jerk .
its better to young women to pursue young women , given the tendency by men to be offensive offensive
i went out with my ex for 3 years and then he / she cheated .
u will know in time , and i thnk seeing what happens for 6 months
well the one i enjoyed goes something like this .
not all gentlemen break up with their woman .
going there is great fun , and there are plenty of things to do .
is it okay to kiss on the first date ?
i have a female friend that i m close with .
they lust for each other .
my friend tells me that i m too nice , and that i should tell him no .
but , because there is always an exception , is there not ?
not all men , hey some men do .
by doing so , you 're still able to retain ur frends .
approach her , say hi , and ask if she is single .
that really aroused me sexually , but i ran away .
girls who are heavier can still be hot
not every bein present is attending <unk> courses .
practice <unk> <unk> and <unk> cherry <unk> , with your tongue .
i will pay if i can get ur vote for best answer ...... ur answer
u should look for somewhere in public , where u will feel most comfortable
flirt with him and gauge his reaction
and it <unk> the pressure i ' m feeling to invite somebody .
plz say u will go out with me
she does nt forget my mistakes .
how should i approach her , without her thinking i ' m just another man with bad intentions ?
as a man , i may have some insight .
do nt worry , you are only 13 .
always go <unk> riding with company .
if the 2 of you truly love each other , then u will work things out .
eye contact is the key point ......
i can lift him .
he jus has to start over , and regain your trust again .
why do u want to ask her out ?
well i ' m hoping you 'll review this info very realy ......
try playing , ' truth or dare , ' together .
wait until u find out and confirm , then go from there .
that s stupid because you need a theory class for that .
just quit if you do eat something like that .
i keep thinking about sex with her .
the only way u will know is if u confront him and ask him directly
<unk> is going to ask <unk> out on a date .
the relationship is still happening because neither of u have the courage to end things
it may be that it is interesting for them to learn about that
he dribbles , shoots , and scores : 2 points
do men realy prefer bigger women ?
he loves u as well , but only time can tell what will happen
if a man really respects you , he will understand u
we ve started our own sins
his answer works for me
u can still love him , but u need to move on .
